# RemixID
## a workshop on the Self and on Identity

What is the self?

What happens when this complex cultural apparatus is mediated through algorithms and technologies?

How this transformations affect our public, private and intimate space?

RemixID is a 3 day hands-on workshop to explore the boundary of the self and of the concept of identity in the era of ubiquitous technology, social networks and algorithmic mediation.
